LeaderWorkerSet: An API for deploying a group of pods as a unit of replication. It aims to address common deployment patterns of AI/ML inference workloads, especially multi-host inference workloads where the LLM will be sharded and run across multiple devices on multiple nodes.
The initial design and proposal can be found at: <http://bit.ly/k8s-LWS>.

## Conceptual view

## Feature overview

- **Group of Pods as a unit:** Supports a tightly managed group of pods that represent a “super pod”
  - **Unique pod identity:** Each pod in the group has a unique index from 0 to n-1.
  - **Parallel creation:** Pods in the group will have the same lifecycle and be created in parallel.
  - **Gang Scheduling:** Each replica with a group of pods can be scheduled in an all-or-nothing manner (Alpha level, API may change in the future).
- **Dual-template, one for leader and one for the workers:** A replica is a group of a single leader and a set of workers, and allow to specify a template for the workers and optionally use a second one for the leader pod.
- **Multiple groups with identical specifications:** Supports creating multiple “replicas” of the above mentioned group. Each group is a single unit for rolling update, scaling, and maps to a single exclusive topology for placement.
- **A scale subresource:** A scale endpoint is exposed for HPA to dynamically scale the number replicas (aka number of groups)
- **Rollout and Rolling update:** Supports performing rollout and rolling update at the group level, which means the groups are upgraded one by one as a unit (i.e. the pods within a group are updated together).
- **Topology-aware placement:** Opt-in support for pods in the same group to be co-located in the same topology.
- **All-or-nothing restart for failure handling:** Opt-in support for all pods in the group to be recreated if one pod in the group failed or one container in the pods is restarted.
