## Summary

This KEP proposes adding `DisaggregatedSet` as a new Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to the LeaderWorkerSet (LWS) project. DisaggregatedSet is a higher-level abstraction that orchestrates multiple LeaderWorkerSets with coordinated lifecycle management, specifically designed for disaggregated inference architectures where multiple roles (e.g., "prefill" and "decode") run on separate infrastructure.

Disaggregated serving is an optimization for LLM inference workloads that takes advantage of the fact that the phases of inference (prefill and decode) have different computational characteristics. State-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks such as [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) support this optimization.

DisaggregatedSet simplifies the deployment of disaggregated LLM inference by:
- Managing multiple LeaderWorkerSets (2-10 roles) as a single logical unit
- Providing coordinated N-dimensional rolling updates across all roles

## Motivation

Currently, deploying disaggregated inference workloads requires users to manually create and coordinate multiple separate LeaderWorkerSets. This leads to several challenges:

1. **Operational complexity**: Users must manually ensure all roles are updated together and handle failure scenarios across multiple resources.

2. **Rolling update coordination**: There is no built-in mechanism to coordinate rolling updates across roles, risking service disruption if one role is updated without the others.

3. **Service lifecycle**: Users must manually manage Services and ensure they only route traffic when all roles are ready.

4. **Configuration drift**: Without a unified resource, role configurations can drift apart, leading to subtle incompatibilities.

### Goals

1. **Unified Management**: Provide a single CRD that manages multiple LeaderWorkerSets (2-10 roles) as a cohesive unit.

2. **Coordinated Rolling Updates**: Implement an N-dimensional rolling update algorithm that updates all roles in lockstep, respecting per-role surge constraints.

3. **Stateless Controller**: Design the controller to derive all state from observed resources, enabling safe restarts at any point.

### Non-Goals

1. **Auto-scaling support**: HPA/VPA integration or automatic scaling based on inference load metrics is out of scope.

2. **Multi-cluster federation**: Managing DisaggregatedSets across multiple Kubernetes clusters is not addressed.

3. **Custom workload backends**: Supporting backends other than LeaderWorkerSet (e.g., StatefulSet, Deployment) is not planned.

4. **Traffic management / routing**: Integration with service meshes or ingress controllers for traffic splitting during rollouts is out of scope.

## Proposal

We propose adding a new CRD called `DisaggregatedSet` that acts as a higher-level controller over LeaderWorkerSet resources. The DisaggregatedSet controller will:

1. Create and manage multiple LeaderWorkerSets (one per role, 2-10 roles supported)
2. Coordinate rolling updates using an N-dimensional algorithm
3. Automatically create headless Services for each role per revision

### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: The N-dimensional rolling update algorithm adds complexity that could lead to stuck rollouts.

**Mitigation**: The algorithm is designed with safety invariants (scale up before scale down, coordinated drain) and the controller is stateless, allowing manual intervention by scaling replicas directly if needed.

**Risk**: Adding a new CRD increases the API surface and maintenance burden.

**Mitigation**: DisaggregatedSet is additive and does not modify existing LeaderWorkerSet behavior. Users who don't need disaggregated inference can continue using LeaderWorkerSet directly.

## Design Details

### DisaggregatedSet API

```go
// DisaggregatedSet is the Schema for the disaggregated sets API
type DisaggregatedSet struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    Spec   DisaggregatedSetSpec   `json:"spec"`
    Status DisaggregatedSetStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}

// DisaggregatedSetSpec defines the desired state of DisaggregatedSet
// +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="self.roles.all(r, self.roles.filter(s, s.name == r.name).size() == 1)",message="role names must be unique"
// +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="self.roles.all(r, r.replicas == 0) || self.roles.all(r, r.replicas > 0)",message="replicas must be zero for all roles or non-zero for all roles"
type DisaggregatedSetSpec struct {
    // Roles defines the list of roles (at least 2 required, maximum 10).
    // Each role has a unique name and its own configuration.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinItems=2
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=10
    // +required
    Roles []DisaggregatedRoleSpec `json:"roles"`
}

// DisaggregatedRoleSpec defines the configuration for a disaggregated role.
type DisaggregatedRoleSpec struct {
    // Name is the unique identifier for this role.
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=63
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Pattern=`^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`
    // +required
    Name string `json:"name"`

    // LeaderWorkerSetTemplateSpec is embedded inline to inherit LWS template fields.
    // Note: RolloutStrategy.Type must be RollingUpdate (or empty) and
    // RolloutStrategy.RollingUpdateConfiguration.Partition must not be set.
    // DisaggregatedSet handles rollouts across roles and does not propagate
    // RolloutStrategy to the underlying LWS resources.
    leaderworkerset.LeaderWorkerSetTemplateSpec `json:",inline"`
}

// LeaderWorkerSetTemplateSpec describes the data a LeaderWorkerSet should have when created
// from a template. This type needs to be added to the LWS API (similar to PodTemplateSpec).
type LeaderWorkerSetTemplateSpec struct {
    // Metadata for the LWS CR. Labels and annotations are propagated to the LWS ObjectMeta.
    // Useful for Kueue integration (kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name) and exclusive-topology
    // scheduling (leaderworkerset.sigs.k8s.io/exclusive-topology).
    // +optional
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    // Spec defines the LeaderWorkerSet configuration.
    // +optional
    Spec leaderworkerset.LeaderWorkerSetSpec `json:"spec,omitempty"`
}
```

**Naming Convention**: LeaderWorkerSets are named `{disaggregatedset-name}-{revision}-{role}` where:
- `revision` is a truncated hash of all role templates (ensures coordinated updates)
- `role` is the role name (e.g., `prefill`, `decode`)

**Labels**: The following labels are applied to managed LeaderWorkerSets:
- `disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/name`: DisaggregatedSet name
- `disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/role`: Role name (e.g., `prefill`, `decode`)
- `disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/revision`: Template hash

### N-Dimensional Rolling Update Algorithm

The rolling update algorithm coordinates all roles using a linear interpolation approach:

```
newAtStep(i) = ceil(i * target / totalSteps)    // scale up: 0 → target
oldAtStep(i) = source - floor(i * source / totalSteps)  // scale down: source → 0
```

**Key Properties**:

1. **Decoupled Steps**: Each step changes EITHER old OR new replicas, not both. This simplifies reasoning about state transitions.

2. **N-Dimensional Coordination**:
   - Scale-up uses `min(role[i].step for all i)` to keep roles in sync
   - Scale-down uses `max(role[i].step for all i)` to ensure all roles drain together

3. **Coordinated Drain**: If any role reaches 0 replicas, all roles are forced to 0. This prevents orphaned single-role workloads from interrupted rollouts.

4. **Surge Constraints**: Per-role `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` are respected:
   ```
   old + new <= target + maxSurge
   ```

5. **Scale-Up Priority**: New replicas are scaled up before old replicas are scaled down, ensuring capacity is never below the minimum.

6. **Stability Check**: The controller waits for `replicas == readyReplicas` before computing the next step.

**Example 1: Two-Role Rollout** (5 prefill, 2 decode → 5 prefill, 2 decode, maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1):

```
┌──────┬────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬─────────────┬───────┬───────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP │ OLD DECODE │ OLD PREFILL │ NEW DECODE │ NEW PREFILL │ TOTAL │            ACTION             │
├──────┼────────────┼─────────────┼────────────┼─────────────┼───────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ 0    │ 2          │ 5           │ 0          │ 0           │ 7     │ initial                       │

└──────┴────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┴─────────────┴───────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

Key observations:
- Prefill progresses through more steps due to higher replica count
- Decode only changes when proportionally appropriate
- Total capacity is maintained throughout: `old + new` stays within surge limits per role

### Service Orchestration

Headless Services are automatically created for each role per revision. This allows load balancers (e.g., llm-d) to count pods per revision across all roles and route traffic proportionally during rolling updates.

- **Naming**: `{disaggregatedset-name}-{revision}-{role}-prv` (e.g., `my-llm-abc12345-prefill-prv`)
- **Selector**: Selects pods from the specific revision's LeaderWorkerSet for that role
- **Cleanup**: Managed via owner references and garbage collected with the DisaggregatedSet

### Controller Architecture

The controller is stateless—all state is derived from observed resources. An `initial-replicas` annotation tracks the starting replica count for rolling updates. Owner references on managed LeaderWorkerSets and Services ensure proper garbage collection.

### Test Plan

[X] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

#### Unit tests

- Rolling update planner: step computation, edge cases, constraint violations
- Executor: scale-up/scale-down coordination, stability checks
- Service manager: creation conditions, cleanup logic
- API validation: role count, unique names, replica constraints

#### Integration tests

- DisaggregatedSet creation creates LeaderWorkerSets for all roles
- Template update triggers coordinated rolling update
- Headless Services created for each role
- Interrupted rollout resumes correctly after controller restart
- Deletion cascades to owned resources

### Graduation Criteria

## Implementation History

- 2026-03-05: Initial KEP draft
- 2026-03-22: Updated to reflect N-dimensional roles API
- 2026-03-23: Renamed "phase" to "role" throughout for semantic clarity

## Drawbacks

1. **Increased Complexity**: Adding another CRD increases the API surface and learning curve for new users.

2. **Controller Overhead**: Managing an additional controller layer adds some overhead, though minimal for typical deployment sizes.

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Extend LeaderWorkerSet with Multi-Template Support

Instead of a new CRD, extend LeaderWorkerSet to support multiple pod templates with labels distinguishing "roles" (prefill vs decode).

**Rejected because**:
- Significantly changes LeaderWorkerSet semantics
- Makes the core LWS controller more complex
- Rolling update coordination would be harder to implement within a single resource

### Alternative 2: Helm Chart or Kustomize Overlay

Provide a Helm chart that creates multiple coordinated LeaderWorkerSets.

**Rejected because**:
- No runtime coordination for rolling updates
- Users would need to implement their own update strategy
- Services cannot be conditionally created based on workload readiness

### Alternative 3: External Controller Without CRD

Build an external controller that watches LeaderWorkerSets with specific labels and coordinates them.

**Rejected because**:
- Poor user experience (no single resource to manage)
- Harder to discover and use
- State management would be complex without a CRD

### Alternative 4: Use LWS Partition Field Instead of Multiple LWS per Revision

Instead of creating separate LeaderWorkerSets per revision (resulting in up to 2N LWS during updates for N roles), use the LWS `partition` field to perform in-place updates within a single LWS per role.

**How it would work**:
- DisaggregatedSet creates exactly N LWS: one per role
- Rolling updates manipulate the `partition` field on each LWS to progressively update groups
- Groups with ordinal `>= partition` get the new template; groups `< partition` remain on old

**Why we chose multiple LWS per revision instead**:

1. **Revision-aware traffic routing**: DisaggregatedSet is designed for disaggregated inference, where a load balancer must route requests to backends whose counterparts are on the **same revision**. With separate LWS (and Service) per revision, each pod's revision is explicit via labels (`disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/revision`). The load balancer can count backends per revision across all role pools and distribute traffic proportionally. With partition-based updates, pods within the same LWS have different templates based on ordinal, making revision-aware routing significantly more complex.

2. **LWS as a read-only resource**: Treating LWS as a read-only resource (similar to how Deployment treats ReplicaSet) makes more sense for this use case. During a coordinated rollout, you want to update roles at different paces depending on the step—it's a tied update across N dimensions. This level of control is difficult to achieve with partition, which operates on a single LWS independently.

3. **Ops observability**: Separate LWS per revision is simpler for ops observability. You can see directly at which stage your update is, since you can see the version right away during updates (e.g., "old-prefill: 2 replicas, new-prefill: 3 replicas") rather than inspecting partition boundaries within a single LWS.

**Trade-offs acknowledged**:
- **Resource overhead**: Up to 2N LWS exist during updates vs. N. However, LWS is a lightweight coordination resource; the actual pod count remains the same.
- **Complexity**: The N-dimensional rolling update algorithm is more complex than coordinating N partition values. However, this complexity is encapsulated in the DisaggregatedSet controller.

**Potential LWS improvements that could enable partition-based approach**:
- Pod-level revision labels (independent of LWS name) would help with traffic routing
- Revision-aware service selectors at the LWS level
