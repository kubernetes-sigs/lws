## Before you begin

Make sure the following conditions are met:

- A Kubernetes cluster with version >= 1.26 is **Required**, or it will behave unexpected. Learn how to [install the Kubernetes tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
    - For any cluster with version 1.26, you need to enable the [feature gate][feature_gate] for [Start Ordinal][start_ordinal] manually. For version greater than 1.26, it's enabled by default.
    - Rolling update with max unavailable Pods, you must enable the [MaxUnavailableStatefulSet][max_unavailable] feature gate, which is still in alpha since Kubernetes v1.24, see discussion [here][max_unavailable_enhancement]. Or lws will roll out the pods one by one.
- Your cluster has at least 1 node with 1+ CPUs and 1G of memory available for the LeaderWorkerSet controller manager Deployment to run on. **NOTE: On some cloud providers, the default node machine type will not have sufficient resources to run the LeaderWorkerSet controller manager and all the required kube-system pods, so you'll need to use a larger
machine type for your nodes.**
- The kubectl command-line tool has communication with your cluster.

## Install a released version

### Install by kubectl

To install a released version of LeaderWorkerSet in your cluster, run the following command:

```shell
VERSION=v0.6.1
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws/releases/download/$VERSION/manifests.yaml
```

To wait for LeaderWorkerSet to be fully available, run:

```shell
kubectl wait deploy/lws-controller-manager -n lws-system --for=condition=available --timeout=5m
```

### Install by Helm

To install a released version of lws in your cluster by [Helm](https://helm.sh/), run the following command:

```shell
CHART_VERSION=0.6.1
helm install lws oci://registry.k8s.io/lws/charts/lws \
  --version=$CHART_VERSION \
  --namespace lws-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait --timeout 300s
```

You can also use the following command:

```shell
VERSION=v0.6.1
helm install lws https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws/releases/download/$VERSION/lws-chart-$VERSION.tgz \
  --namespace lws-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait --timeout 300s
```

### Uninstall

To uninstall a released version of LeaderWorkerSet from your cluster, run the following command:

```shell
VERSION=v0.6.1
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws/releases/download/$VERSION/manifests.yaml
```

To uninstall a released version of LeaderWorkerSet from your cluster by Helm, run the following command:

```shell
helm uninstall lws --namespace lws-system
```

## Install the latest development version

To install the latest development version of LeaderWorkerSet in your cluster, run the
following command:

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side -k github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws/config/default?ref=main
```

The controller runs in the `lws-system` namespace.

### Uninstall

To uninstall LeaderWorkerSet, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl delete -k github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws/config/default
```

## Build and install from source

To build LeaderWorkerSet from source and install LeaderWorkerSet in your cluster, run the following
commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws.git
cd lws
IMAGE_REGISTRY=<registry>/<project> make image-push deploy
```

### Uninstall

To uninstall LeaderWorkerSet, run the following command:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Install in a different namespace

To install the leaderWorkerSet controller in a different namespace rather than `lws-system`, you should first:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws.git
cd lws
```
Then change the [kustomization.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws/blob/main/config/default/kustomization.yaml) _namespace_ field as:
```yaml
namespace: <your-namespace>
```

## Optional: Use cert manager instead of internal cert
The webhooks use an internal certificate by default. However, if you wish to use cert-manager (which
supports cert rotation), instead of internal cert, follow the [cert manage guide](/docs/manage/cert_manager).

## Install with Helm chart

Please refer to the release page for [helm charts][helm_charts].
